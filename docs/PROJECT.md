# Project Structure

This document explains the structure of the `sound_composer` project, including the purpose of each directory and file.

## **Root Directory (`sound_composer/`)**
This is the main project directory containing all the necessary files for building and running the project.

### **1. `assets/`**
- Stores audio files used for testing and processing.
- Example files:
  - `sample1.wav` - Example WAV file for testing.
  - `sample2.wav` - Another sample WAV file.

### **2. `build/`**
- This is the directory where the compiled binaries and object files are generated.
- It is created when you run `cmake ..` inside the `build/` folder.
- The executable `sound_composer` is generated here.

### **3. `docs/`**
- Stores documentation and related files.

### **4. `output/`**
- Directory for storing processed output files (if applicable).

### **5. `src/`** (Source Code Directory)
This folder contains all source code files and is organized into different subdirectories based on functionality.

#### **`src/audio/`**
- Contains utility functions for audio processing.
- **Files:**
  - `util.c` - Implementation of audio-related helper functions.
  - `util.h` - Header file declaring audio utility functions.

#### **`src/core/`**
- Contains the main logic of the application.
- **Files:**
  - `main.c` - The entry point of the application, handling file input, processing, and rendering.

### **6. Build System Files**
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Configuration file for CMake to manage the build process.
- `Makefile` - Automatically generated by CMake for building the project.

### **7. Other Files**
- `README.md` - General information about the project, how to install dependencies, and how to use the program.
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - This file, explaining the directory structure.

## **Compilation & Execution**
### **Building the Project**
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### **Running the Program**
```sh
./sound_composer
```
Ensure the audio files are present in the correct location before running the program.
